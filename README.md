# KIATUU
A simulation of a real life Ecommerce landing page showcasing a number of products offered by the hypothetical KIATUU fotware online store

It properly showcases:

- A product grid using CSS and tailwind with hover effects and micro-interactions
- A detailed modal on the Get Started button that opens on a click
- A shopping cart side bar
- Responsive product cards with product image, rating stars, add to cart button, prices and detailed prescriptions.
- Proper topography and colour use for readability.
